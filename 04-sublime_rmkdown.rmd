# RMarkdown with Sublime

> Memory is the diary we all carry about with us. But memory is also fragile and fallible. We need to start documenting things. 

One of the best things for R markdown is that you can write and code on the same surface. However, the interface of RStudio feels like more "brief writing" than "proper writing". For all the writing, I prefer to do it in Sublime because it's fast and code-integrated. 

The way to do is to install `R-box` and `knitr` in the Sumline. 

- Shift + CMD + P
- Select `R-box` or `knitr` packages
- Once the installation is finished, please make sure the file type is R Markdown from the bottom right corner. 
- You should provide a basic YAML setting for your R markdown. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
