> The best way to choose what to keep and what to throw away is to take each item in one’s hand and ask: “Does this spark joy?” If it does, keep it. If not, dispose of it. This is not only the simplest but also the most accurate yardstick by which to judge.

## Tidy your files

There're a number of ways to organise data science work. The key is to set up Rproject and GitHub. Here we list two main approaches to achieve this end.  

The first way is the __pull__ way where we get both Rproject and git integrated from outside - GitHub. You use the `github` function from `usethis` package and put down ("OWNER/REPO_NAME") and opt for https when you get asked on git protocol. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
> usethis::create_from_github("dataning/learn_usethis")

Which git protocol to use? (enter 0 to exit) 

1: ssh   <-- presumes that you have set up ssh keys
2: https <-- choose this if you don't have ssh keys (or don't know if you do)

Selection: 2
● Tip: To suppress this menu in future, put
  `options(usethis.protocol = "https")`
  in your script or in a user- or project-level startup file, '.Rprofile'.
  Call `usethis::edit_r_profile()` to open it for editing.
✔ Cloning repo from 'https://github.com/dataning/learn_usethis.git' into '/Users/sushicat/Desktop/learn_usethis'
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/sushicat/Desktop/learn_usethis'
✔ Writing 'learn_usethis.Rproj'
✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'
✔ Opening '/Users/sushicat/Desktop/learn_usethis/' in new RStudio session
✔ Setting active project to '<no active project>'
```

The second way is to imagine you're working in a random folder and you wish to set up the Rproject 
```{r eval=FALSE}
> library(usethis)
> library(here)

here() starts at /Users/sushicat/Dropbox/R_Me
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
> here::here()
[1] "/Users/sushicat/Dropbox/R_Me"
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
> path <- file.path(here(), "learn_usethis")
create_project(path)

✔ Creating '/Users/sushicat/Dropbox/R_Me/learn_usethis/'
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/sushicat/Dropbox/R_Me/learn_usethis'
✔ Creating 'R/'
✔ Writing 'learn_usethis.Rproj'
✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'
✔ Opening '/Users/sushicat/Dropbox/R_Me/learn_usethis/' in new RStudio session
✔ Setting active project to '<no active project>'
```
